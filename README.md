# MyStadium Backened

This is the backend portion of our application. It is best to clone this down before the frontend. This handles all the logic of the app.

# Getting Started
The first thing you want to do is clone both this and the frontend portion of the app. I will briefly explain in the instructions below how to install the backened portion of the app.

# Installing

- Open up your text editor's terminal and run 'bundle install'. Our gem-file is up to date so you shouldn't need to install any new gems.
- First, run 'rails db:create', followed by 'rails db:migrate', then 'rails db:seed'.
- Run 'rails s' to get the server started.
- A localhost tab should open in your browser; explore it to see the json data from our database
- With the backend up and running you'll be able to log into the application once you install the front end.
